# About me
My name is Thayer Luscian, and I’m a designer, digital marketer, and all-around computer nerd who **stands on the shoulders of giants**. By combining open-source designs and technologies with my own personal touch, I create wonderful things.

# Services


## Design + Development
I build *secure, beautiful, affordable* websites using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/). All of my sites are served securely over **HTTPS**, a feature (that usually costs hundreds of dollars) provided for free by [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). For eCommerce systems, I use [PayPal for Business](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-standard), a secure and trusted platform that supports all major credit cards and PayPal for only **2.9% + $0.30** per transaction, with integrated in-store options available. Unlike other developers, I use open-source resources and therefore *only charge my clients for my time and their domain names* (the .com or .org address, usually about $12).


I also design top-notch graphics to go along with my clients’ websites and social media presences.


## Digital marketing


### Social media
As a late millennial, I have experienced the qualities and effects of a good social media presence first-hand, and have successfully worked on the Facebook pages of several small businesses and organizations, and have the resources to attract the attention of tens of thousands of people.


### Email marketing
Email marketing is an excellent way to engage customers, and my go-to platform, (MailChimp)[https://mailchimp.com/], is capable of doing just that. By designing branded email templates and assisting in content development, I can help small business reach an oft-neglected yet essential platform.


### Web analytics
Web analytics is often over-complicated by its proponents, prompting most business owners to overlook it. However, the metrics it provides are indispensable to understanding one’s market, and can help businesses to tailor marketing materials to fit the needs of their customers. [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/#) provides detailed insights on the demographics and interests of any website visitors and is provided with all websites at **no additional charge**.
